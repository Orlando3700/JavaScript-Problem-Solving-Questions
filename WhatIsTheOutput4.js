// What will be the output of the given code?

// '6' is a string, so when you use the '-' operator with string and
// number, JavaScript convert the string to a number automatically
// which is called type coercion. '6' gets converted to the number 6,
// then 6 - 1 = 5. So, 5 is the answer.

console.log('6' - 1);
