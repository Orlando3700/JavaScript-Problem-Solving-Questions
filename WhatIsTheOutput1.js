// What will be the output of the given code?

// The code uses the reduce method on the array [1, 2, 3] to sum
// its elements. It takes two parameters, a (accumulator) and b
// (current value), adding them together. The final result 6 is
// printed to the console, representing the total of the array's
// numbers.

console.log([1, 2, 3].reduce((a, b) => a + b));//adds numbers in the array, together using the reduce mehtod
